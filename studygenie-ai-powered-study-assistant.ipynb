By leveraging advanced generative AI capabilities, StudyGenie processes uploaded PDF documents, answers questions with context-aware precision, and generates tailored study resources like summaries, multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and flashcards. This project addresses a real-world problem: the challenge students face in efficiently studying complex materials, retaining key concepts, and preparing for exams.\n\n### Why StudyGenie?\n- **Real-World Impact**: Helps students save time, understand complex topics, and excel in their studies.\n- **Innovative Use Case**: Combines document understanding, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and structured output to create a seamless learning experience.\n- **Gen AI Capabilities**:\n  - **Document Understanding**: Extracts and processes text from PDF documents.\n  - **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Provides accurate answers by retrieving relevant document chunks.\n  - **Structured Output/JSON Mode**: Delivers answers in a consistent JSON format for clarity and usability.\n  - **Embeddings**: Uses AI embeddings to enable semantic search within documents.\n\n### How It Works\n1. **Upload a PDF**: Students upload study materials (e.g., lecture notes, textbooks).\n2. **Process Documents**: The AI extracts text, splits it into chunks, and creates a vector database for efficient retrieval.\n3. **Ask Questions**: Students ask questions, and StudyGenie retrieves relevant context to provide concise, accurate answers.\n4. **Generate Study Materials**: The AI creates summaries, MCQs, and flashcards to reinforce learning.\n\n### Target Audience\n- Students preparing for exams.\n- Educators creating study resources.\n- Lifelong learners seeking to understand complex texts.\n\nThis notebook demonstrates a fully functional prototype, showcasing how generative AI can revolutionize education. Let’s dive into the code and see StudyGenie in action! 🚀","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Installing Dependencies\n\nThis cell installs the necessary Python packages to power StudyGenie’s AI capabilities. It’s a critical first step to ensure the notebook can process PDFs, generate embeddings, perform RAG, and create structured outputs.\n\n**Why It’s Important**:\n- Installs libraries like `langchain` for RAG and chaining AI tasks.\n- Includes `pypdf` for document understanding (PDF parsing).\n- Sets up `sentence-transformers` and `faiss-cpu` for embeddings and vector search.\n- Adds `ipywidgets` for an interactive user interface.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install required packages\n!pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-google-genai pypdf
